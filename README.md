# Terraform

TFLint is a popular open-source static analysis tool designed for Terraform. It performs automated checks on Terraform configurations to identify potential issues, errors, and violations of best practices. TFLint helps maintain code quality, consistency, and reliability in Terraform projects.

Tfsec is a static analysis tool used to scan Terraform code to identify security gaps in IaC. It analyzes Terraform codebases to identify potential security issues such as misconfigurations, insecure settings, and other issues that might expose infrastructure to risks.

Terratest is an open source testing framework for infrastructure defined using Terraform. It performs unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for the cloud-based infrastructure and helps identify security vulnerabilities early on.


The pipeline will be designed to trigger automatically upon code push to GitHub, and will encompass code analysis, security analysis, testing, and the typical Terraform workflow stages such as initialization, planning, and applying changes.
